				<h4 class="mid-two">Let's be honest, training your dog to do cute tricks is awesome, but being able to balance kibble on her nose isn't so impressive if she's still chewing everyone's shoes and jumping all over every new person she meets. Here is some guidance on training your dog to stop offering certain behaviours that may have become habit.
				</h4>

				<h3 class="mid-two">Unwanted behaviours:</h3>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Inappropriate chewing (shoes, socks, furniture, etc)</li>
				<li>Barking at passing cars</li>
				<li>Barking/jumping/pawing to get your attention</li>
				<li>Chasing/lunging at joggers and cyclists</li>
				<li>Eliminating (weeing or pooping) in inappropriate places</li>
				<li>Jumping when greeting new people</li>
				<li>Separation anxiety</li>
				<li>Barking/lunging at other dogs when on or off leash</li>
				<li>Barking/lunging at people when on or off leash</li>
				<li>...</li>
				</ul></h4>

				<h3 class="mid-two">Desired behaviours:</h3>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Greeting people calmly</li>
				<li>Staying in a designated place (like a dog bed) while you eat dinner</li>
				<li>Being quiet when there are loud noises outside</li>
				<li>Keeping attention on you even around distractions on walks</li>
				<li>Greeting other dogs calmly on walks</li>
				</ul></h4>

				<h3 class="bottom-two">The secret to changing a dog's behaviour:</h3>
				<h4>
				If you want your dog to stop doing something: 
				<ol>
				<li>Prevent the unwanted behaviour from occurring</li>
				<li>Ensure the unwanted behaviour is never reinforced</li>
				<br/><br/>
				If you want your dog to do something more often:
				<ol>
				<li>Encourage the wanted behaviour</li>
				<li>Reward the wanted behaviour when it occurs</li>
				<br/></h4>
			</div>
				<br/>
				<h4>
				It really is that simple! Here are some more details, but the above two statements are the core of everything else on this page, and in fact, they're really two sides of the same coin.
				<br/><br/>
				A dog will continue to do something if he is rewarded for doing so. This is easy to believe with behaviours you are trying to encourage. If you give your dog a treat every time he goes to his bed, he'll start to join the dots: "my owner gives me a treat when I go to my bed - I should go to my bed more often!". You'll start to see him go to his bed more often.<br/><br/>
				But what about behaviours that you're not reinforcing? I bet you're not rewarding your dog every time she steals some food from the counter. However, these behaviours are <i>self-rewarding</i>: if your dog steals a bacon sandwich, she's rewarded with a bacon sandwich! If she chews on a shoe, she's rewarded with all the fun of chewing on a shoe. So every time your dog steals a sandwich, she's learning that she should steal more sandwiches!<br/><br/>
				Following this thinking, if you want to <strong>increase</strong> the frequency of a behaviour, encourage and reward it! If Pooch sits nicely on his mat while you eat dinner, "good boy!" and toss him a treat. If he's begging by your feet, encourage him to go to his bed (see here for some ideas on training a "go to bed" command), and reward him when he does so. Your dog will learn "if I sit on my mat while my owner eats, I get treats, how wonderful!", so your dog is more likely to stay on his bed while you eat.<br/><br/>
				Conversely, if you want to <strong>decrease</strong> the frequency of a behaviour, make sure the behaviour is <i>never</i> being reinforced. Let's say your dog begs at the table. Some of the time you'll ignore him or tell him off, so his behaviour (begging) gets no reinforcement. But every now and again you'll give in (and believe me, I know how hard it is to resist those puppy dog eyes). However, on those times that you give in, you're teaching your dog that begging <i>works</i>, and that if he wants food, all he has to do is beg. A similar behaviour is jumping. A lot of owners are happy to shower their dogs with affection if the dog jumps in excitement when the owner comes back from work, but not when the owner is making dinner. This is confusing to poor Fido! How's he meant to know when he is and isn't allowed to jump? The first step is to <i>never</i> reward jumping, and the second step (if you do want to teach your dog that it's OK to jump sometimes) is to teach him to only jump when you say he can (see "Putting behaviours on cue").<br/><br/>
				I'll say it again, because it's so important: if you want your dog to stop doing something, make sure he is never rewarded for doing that thing. How can you ensure he's never rewarded? By not allowing the behaviour to happen in the first place! If your dog doesn't have access to the kitchen, he can't possibly countersurf, which means he is never rewarded for countersurfing. If you put your shoes away in a cupboard, your dog will never get a chance to chew on shoes. If you don't let your dog get close enough to strangers on walks, he'll never get the chance to find out how much fun it is to jump on strangers.<br/><br/>
				Naturally you want your dog to do the "right thing" if you do accidentally leave a shoe in his reach, and you want to train proper greeting etiquette for meeting strangers, but set your dog up for success by making the "wrong thing" as difficult as possible.<br/><br/>
				</h4>

				<h3 class="mid-two">The general recipe for changing a dog's unwanted behaviour:</h3>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li><strong>Pinpoint the unwanted behaviour.</strong> E.g., jumping up on guests when they come in the house.</li>
				<li><strong>Decide what you want the dog to do instead of the unwanted behaviour.</strong> E.g., stay on his bed until you give a release cue, and to keep all four paws on the floor at all times.</li>
				<li><strong>Prevent the unwanted behaviour from happening.</strong> E.g., leash your dog so they can't get close enough to jump on the guest.</li>
				<li><strong>Encourage the behaviour you <i>want</i> your dog to offer.</strong> E.g., while on leash, lure your dog to his bed and treat him for staying on his bed.</li>
				<li><strong>Repeat!</strong> Invite friends over just so you can train your dog. Don't wait for "real" guests to arrive as you might be distracted between hosting and training your dog, and this may not happen frequently enough for the training to be effective.</li>
				<li><strong>Reduce the rate of reward</strong> as your dog's behaviour improves (e.g., it is easier to lure him onto his mat, easier to keep him there, and if he is keeping his paws on the floor more often around guests). E.g., if you started off needing to reward your dog once every few seconds, reduce the reward rate to once every five or ten seconds. The end goal is for your dog to go to his bed without prompting, after all!</li>
				<li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> Every time a guest comes round, if your dog is still in training, make sure he will be unable to practice the unwanted behaviour (jumping), and encourage him to practice the wanted behaviour (sitting on his mat). If you're unable to keep an eye on him one day (maybe a big crowd is coming over, or you'll be in a rush, or you need to host), put your dog in a quiet room or in his crate or ask someone trustworthy to help - but don't give your dog a chance to backslide.
				<li><strong>DO NOT LET GUESTS REWARD YOUR DOG'S JUMPING!</strong> Training a dog can be relatively easy, but training guests is not! "It's OK, I don't mind" or even "I like it when dogs jump on me!" are things I've heard from people as they fuss over my dog and reward her for jumping all over them. Partly my mistake for putting my dog in a position where she <i>could</i> jump, with the unfortunate consequence that the guest has now rewarded her for jumping.</li>
				</ol>
				</h4>

				<h3 class="mid-two">Some common questions:</h3>
				<h4 class=<bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Is my dog just doing X to get a treat?<br/>Take, for example, treating your dog every time she goes to her bed. She will start going to her bed more often. Is that just because she wants a treat? Well... Maybe. But the more often your dog chooses to go to her bed, and the more often she has positive associations with her bed (be it getting a treat, or some affection or praise from you, or simply a pleasant nap), the more likely she is to spend more time on her bed.</li>
				<li>My dog only does something if I have food!<br/>Aha, you've been cursed with a smart dog, who is just asking "what's in it for me?"</li>
				<li></li>
				<li></li>
				<li></li>
				<li>...</li>
				</ol>
				</h4>

				<h1 class="top-three">List of unwanted behaviours:</h1>

				<h2>Inappropriate chewing</h2>
				<p class="bottom-three">The important word here is "inappropriate"; there are plenty of appropriate things out there for your dog to chew, you just need to teach him the difference!</p>

				<h2>Jumping on people</h2>
				<p class="bottom-three">I know a lot of us are dog people through and through, but even so, having a furry tornado in your face isn't always desirable.</p>
