				<h4 class="mid-two">Let's be honest, training your dog to do cute tricks is awesome, but being able to balance kibble on her nose isn't so impressive if she's still chewing everyone's shoes and jumping all over every new person she meets. Here is some guidance on training your dog to stop offering certain behaviours that may have become habit.
				</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Some unwanted behaviours:</h2>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Inappropriate chewing (shoes, socks, furniture, etc)</li>
				<li>Barking at passing cars</li>
				<li>Chasing/lunging at joggers, cyclists and other dogs</li>
				<li>Barking/jumping/pawing to get your attention</li>
				<li>Eliminating (weeing or pooping) in inappropriate places</li>
				<li>Begging at the table when you're eating dinner</li>
				</ul></h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Some desirable behaviours:</h2>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Only chewing designated chew toys</li>
				<li>Keeping attention on you even around distractions on walks</li>
				<li>Calmly greeting or ignoring dogs on walks</li>
				<li>Settling quietly if you are busy (e.g., cooking, working)</li>
				<li>Ask to go outside by pawing the door gently or ringing a bell</li>
				<li>Staying in a designated place (like a dog bed) while you eat dinner</li>
				<li>Being quiet when there are loud noises outside</li>

				<h2 class="bottom-two">The secret to controlling a dog's behaviour</h2>
				<h4>
				<strong>If you want your dog to do something more often:</strong><br/>
				- Encourage the desirable behaviour<br/>
				- Reward the desirable behaviour when it occurs<br/>
				<br/>
				<strong>If you want your dog to do something less often: </strong><br/>
				- Prevent the unwanted behaviour from occurring<br/>
				- Ensure the unwanted behaviour is never reinforced<br/>
				<br/></h4>
			</div>
				<br/>
				<h4>
				It really is that simple! Here are some more details, but the above two statements are the core of everything else on this page, and in fact, they're really two sides of the same coin.
				<br/><br/>
				A dog will continue to do something if he is rewarded for doing so. This is easy to believe with behaviours you are trying to encourage. If you give your dog a treat every time he goes to his bed, he'll start to join the dots: "my owner gives me a treat when I go to my bed - I should go to my bed more often!". You'll start to see him go to his bed more often.<br/><br/>
				But what about behaviours that you're not reinforcing? I bet you're not rewarding your dog every time she steals some food from the counter. However, these behaviours are <i>self-rewarding</i>: if your dog steals a bacon sandwich, she's rewarded with a bacon sandwich! If she chews on a shoe, she's rewarded with all the fun of chewing on a shoe. So every time your dog steals a sandwich, she's learning that she should steal more sandwiches!<br/><br/>
				Following this thinking, if you want to <strong>increase</strong> the frequency of a behaviour, encourage and reward it! If Pooch sits nicely on his mat while you eat dinner, "good boy!" and toss him a treat. If he's begging by your feet, encourage him to go to his bed (see here for some ideas on training a "go to bed" command), and reward him when he does so. Your dog will learn "if I sit on my mat while my owner eats, I get treats, how wonderful!", so your dog is more likely to stay on his bed while you eat.<br/><br/>
				Conversely, if you want to <strong>decrease</strong> the frequency of a behaviour, make sure the behaviour is <i>never</i> being reinforced. Let's say your dog begs at the table. Some of the time you'll ignore him or tell him off, so his behaviour (begging) gets no reinforcement. But every now and again you'll give in (and believe me, I know how hard it is to resist those puppy dog eyes). However, on those times that you give in, you're teaching your dog that begging <i>works</i>, and that if he wants food, all he has to do is beg. A similar behaviour is jumping. A lot of owners are happy to shower their dogs with affection if the dog jumps in excitement when the owner comes back from work, but not when the owner is making dinner. This is confusing to poor Fido! How's he meant to know when he is and isn't allowed to jump? The first step is to <i>never</i> reward jumping, and the second step (if you do want to teach your dog that it's OK to jump sometimes) is to teach him to only jump when you say he can (see "Putting behaviours on cue").<br/><br/>
				I'll say it again, because it's so important: if you want your dog to stop doing something, make sure he is never rewarded for doing that thing. How can you ensure he's never rewarded? By not allowing the behaviour to happen in the first place! If your dog doesn't have access to the kitchen, he can't possibly countersurf, which means he is never rewarded for countersurfing. If you put your shoes away in a cupboard, your dog will never get a chance to chew on shoes. If you don't let your dog get close enough to strangers on walks, he'll never get the chance to find out how much fun it is to jump on strangers.<br/><br/>
				Naturally you want your dog to do the "right thing" if you do accidentally leave a shoe in his reach, and you want to train proper greeting etiquette for meeting strangers, but set your dog up for success by making the "wrong thing" as difficult as possible.<br/><br/>
				</h4>

				<h1 class="mid-two">The general recipe for unwanted behaviour</h1>
				<!- Put this in two columns, left: instruction, right: example ->

				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ol style="1">
				<li><strong>Pinpoint the unwanted behaviour.</strong><br/>E.g., jumping up on guests when they come in the house.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Decide what you want the dog to do instead of the unwanted behaviour.</strong><br/>E.g., stay on his bed until you give a release cue, and to keep all four paws on the floor at all times.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Prevent the unwanted behaviour from happening.</strong><br/>E.g., leash your dog so they can't get close enough to jump on the guest.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Encourage the behaviour you <i>want</i> your dog to offer.</strong><br/>E.g., while on leash, lure your dog to his bed and treat him for staying on his bed.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Repeat repeat repeat!</strong><br/>Invite friends over just so you can train your dog. Don't wait for "real" guests to arrive as you might be distracted between hosting and training your dog, and this may not happen frequently enough for the training to be effective.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Reduce the rate of reward</strong> as your dog's behaviour improves.<br/>E.g., if you started off needing to reward your dog once every few seconds, reduce the reward rate to once every five or ten seconds. The end goal is for your dog to go to his bed without prompting, after all!</li>
				</ol>

				<h1 class="mid-two">Tips and tricks</h1>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li><strong>Be consistent</strong><br/>Every time a guest comes round, if your dog is still in training, make sure he will be unable to practice the unwanted behaviour (jumping), and encourage him to practice the wanted behaviour (sitting on his mat). If you're unable to keep an eye on him one day (maybe a big crowd is coming over, or you'll be in a rush, or you need to host), put your dog in a quiet room or in his crate or ask someone trustworthy to help - but don't give your dog a chance to backslide.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Don't let friends/family undermine your training!</strong><br/>Training a dog can be relatively easy, but training people is not! "It's OK, I don't mind" or even "I like it when dogs jump on me!" are things I've heard from people as they fuss over my dog and reward her for jumping all over them. Partly my mistake for putting my dog in a position where she <i>could</i> jump, with the unfortunate consequence that the guest has now rewarded her for jumping.</li>
				</ul>
				</h4>

				<h1 class="mid-two">Common questions</h1>
				<h4 class=<bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li><strong>Q: Is my dog just doing X to get a treat?</strong><br/>A: Take, for example, treating your dog every time she goes to her bed. She will start going to her bed more often. Is that just because she wants a treat? Well... Yes. But the more often your dog chooses to go to her bed, and the more often she has positive associations with her bed (be it getting a treat, or some affection or praise from you, or simply a pleasant nap), the more likely she is to spend more time on her bed. Over time she'll likely spend more time on her bed out of pure habit, whether you treat her for it or not.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Q: My dog only does something if I have food!</strong><br/>A: Aha, you've been cursed with a smart dog! She knows she'll only be rewarded if she can see the treat in your hand. See (this guide: "your dog is smart, not lazy") for getting your dog to listen, even if you haven't got a treat in your hand.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Q: My dog is still doing the unwanted behaviour!</strong><br/>A: Firstly, it can take hours, days or weeks of consistent training to see a change in your pup's behaviour, so be patient! However, if it has been several weeks and you're seeing no improvements, then something <i>must</i> be reinforcing the unwanted behaviour. For example, if a dog is jumping up at your for attention, you might tell him "no" or push him away when he jumps. However, negative attention is still attention! So you may still be reinforcing the behaviour. An alternative solution in this case would be to completely ignore the dog, or even get up and leave the room as soon as the dog jumps on you. The dog will learn that jumping achieves the opposite of what he wants.<br/><br/>Another reason an unwanted behaviour persists could be that other people are reinforcing it (e.g., your kids are sneaking Rover scraps under the table, so he'll continue to beg), or that there is an underlying issue (a medical problem is making your dog unable to hold in his wee, or your dog has far too much energy to settle for long periods of time and needs some extra stimulation).</li><br/>

				<h1 class="bottom-two">How to train specific unwanted behaviours</h1>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Inappropriate chewing</h2>
				<h4>The important word here is "inappropriate"; there are plenty of appropriate things out there for your dog to chew, you just need to teach him the difference! [...]</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Jumping on people</h2>
				<h4>I know a lot of us are dog people through and through, but even so, having a furry tornado in your face isn't always desirable. [...]</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Play-biting or playing rough</h2>
				<h4>Dogs explore the world with their mouths, and their mouths are inevitably full of teeth. Puppies in particular are very mouthy, especially around the ages of X to Y. [...]</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">House training</h2>
				<h4></h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Crate training</h2>
				<h4></h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Loose leash walking</h2>
				<h4></h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Separation anxiety</h2>
				<h4></h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Barking/lunging at joggers and cyclists</h2>
				<h4></h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Barking/lunging at other dogs</h2>
