				<strong>If you want your dog to do something more often:</strong><br/>
				Encourage the desirable behaviour<br/>

				<br/>
				<strong>If you want your dog to do something less often: </strong><br/>

				<br/>
				<h4>
				It really is that simple! The above two statements are the core of everything else on this page, and in fact, they're just two sides of the same coin.
				<br/><br/>
				<strong>A dog will continue to do something if he is rewarded for doing so.</strong> If you give your dog a treat every time he goes to his bed, he'll start to join the dots: "my owner gives me a treat when I go to my bed - I should go to my bed more often!". You'll start to see him go to his bed more often.
				<br/><br/>
				I bet you're not rewarding your dog every time she steals some food from the counter. However, these behaviours are <i>self-rewarding</i>. If your dog steals a bacon sandwich, she's rewarded with a bacon sandwich! So every time your dog steals a sandwich, she's learning stealing food is great and she's more likely to do it again.
				<br/><br/>
				<strong>A dog will stop doing something if he gets no reward.</strong> Dogs are pretty smart, they'll change tack if what they're doing isn't working. A dog performs a certain behaviour to get a result. If the behaviour no longer achieves that result, he'll try a new behaviour instead. The key here is to choose that new behavior for the dog.
				<!-- Comment body out for now.
				Following this thinking, if you want to <strong>increase</strong> the frequency of a behaviour, encourage and reward it! If Pooch sits nicely on his mat while you eat dinner, "good boy!" and toss him a treat. If he's begging by your feet, encourage him to go to his bed (see here for some ideas on training a "go to bed" command), and reward him when he does so. Your dog will learn "if I sit on my mat while my owner eats, I get treats, how wonderful!", so your dog is more likely to stay on his bed while you eat.<br/><br/>
				Conversely, if you want to <strong>decrease</strong> the frequency of a behaviour, make sure the behaviour is <i>never</i> being reinforced. Let's say your dog begs at the table. Some of the time you'll ignore him or tell him off, so his behaviour (begging) gets no reinforcement. But every now and again you'll give in (and believe me, I know how hard it is to resist those puppy dog eyes). However, on those times that you give in, you're teaching your dog that begging <i>works</i>, and that if he wants food, all he has to do is beg. A similar behaviour is jumping. A lot of owners are happy to shower their dogs with affection if the dog jumps in excitement when the owner comes back from work, but not when the owner is making dinner. This is confusing to poor Fido! How's he meant to know when he is and isn't allowed to jump? The first step is to <i>never</i> reward jumping, and the second step (if you do want to teach your dog that it's OK to jump sometimes) is to teach him to only jump when you say he can (see "Putting behaviours on cue").<br/><br/>
				I'll say it again, because it's so important: if you want your dog to stop doing something, make sure he is never rewarded for doing that thing. How can you ensure he's never rewarded? By not allowing the behaviour to happen in the first place! If your dog doesn't have access to the kitchen, he can't possibly countersurf, which means he is never rewarded for countersurfing. If you put your shoes away in a cupboard, your dog will never get a chance to chew on shoes. If you don't let your dog get close enough to strangers on walks, he'll never get the chance to find out how much fun it is to jump on strangers.<br/><br/>
				Naturally you want your dog to do the "right thing" if you do accidentally leave a shoe in his reach, and you want to train proper greeting etiquette for meeting strangers, but set your dog up for success by making the "wrong thing" as difficult as possible.<br/><br/>

				<h1 class="mid-two">The general recipe for changing behaviour</h1>
				<!- Put this in two columns, left: instruction, right: example ->

				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ol style="1">
				<li><strong>Pinpoint the unwanted behaviour</strong><br/>When starting out on changing a behaviour, be specific. E.g., "jumping up on guests at home" will be treated slightly differently to "jumping on strangers during walks" or "jumping when over-excited at dinner time".</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Decide what you want the dog to do instead</strong><br/>This part is key! Don't just tell your dog off for doing the wrong thing, but show him what you want him to do. E.g., to stay on his bed until you give a release cue, and to keep all four paws on the floor.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Prevent the unwanted behaviour from happening</strong><br/>As mentioned above, a dog will repeat a behaviour if it is being rewarded. The best way to ensure a behaviour is never rewarded is to prevent it from happening. E.g., leash your dog so they can't get close enough to jump on guests.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Encourage the behaviour you <i>want</i> your dog to offer</strong><br/>Don't just wait for your dog to do the "right thing", show him! E.g., while on leash, lure your dog to his bed and treat him for getting onto it.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Repeat repeat repeat!</strong><br/>Practice makes perfect. E.g., invite friends over just so you can train your dog. There's no need to wait for "real" guests to arrive, and specific training sessions lower the stakes.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Reduce the rate of reward as your dog's behaviour improves</strong><br/>The end goal is for your dog to offer the desirable behaviour without being asked or "bribed" with a treat, so gradually phase out the treats. E.g., if you started off needing to reward your dog once every few seconds, reduce the reward rate to once every five or ten seconds. See (here) for some advice on phasing out treats.</li>
				</ol>

				<h1 class="mid-two">Tips and tricks</h1>
				<h4 class="bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li><strong>Consistency is key</strong><br/>Consistency is the most important ingredient to successfully changing a dog's behaviour. If you're sometimes stopping your dog from jumping on guests but not always, he's getting mixed messages. Is it OK to jump or not? By never allowing the unwanted behaviour to occur, you're making it much easier for your dog to understand what you want.<br/><br/>If you're unable to keep an eye on your dog all the time (e.g., you need to host your MIL and can't afford to give all your attention to the dog), put Fido in a quiet room or his crate, or ask someone trustworthy to help - but don't give your dog a chance to backslide and jump over the MIL.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Don't let friends/family undermine your training!</strong><br/>Training a dog can be relatively easy, but training people is not! While training my dog, I asked guests to only pet my dog if all her paws were on the floor. "It's OK, I don't mind!" or even "I like it when dogs jump!" were common replies. (Positive reinforcement also works on guests, I recommend cookies as a suitable reward for appropriate behaviour...)</li>
				</ul>
				</h4>

				<h1 class="mid-two">Common questions</h1>
				<h4 class=<bottom-two">
				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li><strong>Q: Is my dog just doing X to get a treat?</strong><br/>A: Take, for example, treating your dog every time she goes to her bed. She will start going to her bed more often. Is that just because she wants a treat? Well... Yes. But the more often your dog chooses to go to her bed, and the more often she has positive associations with her bed (be it getting a treat, or some affection or praise from you, or simply a pleasant nap), the more likely she is to spend more time on her bed. Over time she'll likely spend more time on her bed out of pure habit, whether you treat her for it or not.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Q: My dog only does something if I have food!</strong><br/>A: Aha, you've been cursed with a smart dog! She knows she'll only be rewarded if she can see the treat in your hand. See (this guide: "your dog is smart, not lazy") for getting your dog to listen, even if you haven't got a treat in your hand.</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Q: My dog is still doing the unwanted behaviour!</strong><br/>A: Firstly, it can take hours, days or weeks of consistent training to see a change in your pup's behaviour, so be patient! However, if it has been several weeks and you're seeing no improvements, then something <i>must</i> be reinforcing the unwanted behaviour. For example, if a dog is jumping up at your for attention, you might tell him "no" or push him away when he jumps. However, negative attention is still attention! So you may still be reinforcing the behaviour. An alternative solution in this case would be to completely ignore the dog, or even get up and leave the room as soon as the dog jumps on you. The dog will learn that jumping achieves the opposite of what he wants.<br/><br/>Another reason an unwanted behaviour persists could be that other people are reinforcing it (e.g., your kids are sneaking Rover scraps under the table, so he'll continue to beg), or that there is an underlying issue (a medical problem is making your dog unable to hold in his wee, or your dog has far too much energy to settle for long periods of time and needs some extra stimulation).</li><br/>
				<li><strong>Q: My dog knows he's not meant to X, why does he still do it?</strong><br/>A: This is a very common misconception. I'll give the example of house training. Dogs will often "sneak away" to wee or poop in a different room, or they'll "look guilty" when you come home. Does this mean they know they're not meant to wee or poop in the house? No!

				</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Inappropriate chewing</h2>
				<h4>
Dogs explore the world with their mouths, and their mouths are inevitably full of teeth. Puppies in particular are very mouthy, especially around the ages of X to Y (teething). The important word here is "inappropriate"; there are plenty of appropriate things out there for your dog to chew, you just need to teach him which are which!</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Jumping on people</h2>
				<h4>I know a lot of us are dog people through and through, but even so, having a furry tornado in your face isn't always desirable.<br/><br/>
				<strong>Ensure the unwanted behaviour is never rewarded:</strong><br/>
Never give your dog attention if they jump up on you. If your dog jumps, turn away and ignore them until four paws are on the floor, then redirect to the desired behaviour (e.g., a sit). If your dog is too excited to sit, leave the room for 30 seconds (or until your dog has calmed down) and try again, immediately trying to lure your dog into a sit. If this means leaving a cache of treats outside your front door so you can arm yourself when you come home, do it!
				<br/><br/>
Importantly, if your dog does jump, ask yourself why it was possible. Could she have been on leash in the situation? If so, make sure she is leashed next time, so that she is unable to practise the unwanted behaviour. You can also get better at predicting the jump: dogs don't teleport next to you, they must approach first. If your dog is approaching and you know there's a good chance she'll jump, whip out a treat and distract her before she can jump. Don't let her practise the unwanted behaviour!
				<br/><br/>
				<strong>Teach an alternative behaviour:</strong><br/>As a general rule, only reward your dog if all four paws are on the floor. Here are some ideas for alternative behaviours, depending on the situation.<br/><br/>
				<ul>
				<li>Greeting you at home: this is where many of us struggle. We love it when our dog is so happy to see us! But allowing uncontrolled jumping isn't the way to go. However, you don't need to give it up completely if you don't want to: when you come in, you can ask your sit for a calm sit, and once he complies, reward him by letting him jump and fussing over him! Rewards don't need to be treats. </li>
				<li>Greeting guests at home: ask your dog to maintain a down stay on his bed while the guests come in, hang their coats and get settled. Once they're comfortable, release your dog from his down stay and allow him to calmly greet the guests.</li>
				<li>Greeting new people on walks: this is something you'll want to practice with friends first, as strangers are often just as badly behaved as your dog! Teach your dog to sit or lie down if he wants to greet people. [Zac George's video] Once your dog is calmly greeting strangers while on leash, you can let him off leash (where it is safe and legal to do so), and continue his training.</li>
				<li>Greeting new dogs on walks: many dogs are <i>extremely</i> excited when they spot another dog on a walk, to the extent they can even appear a little scary! This is discussed in more depth [here] but can be treated similarly to greeting people on walks, with the added complication that the other dog is harder to predict and control. In this situation you may rather focus on keeping your dog's attention on you, even with other dogs around (see here for more information on keeping your dog's attention in highly distracting environments).</li>
				</ul>

				</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Play-biting</h2>
				<h4>
Play-biting is common for young puppies or older dogs who have never been taught otherwise. When a dog play-bites, she either wants to get your attention or to play! And it's almost impossible to ignore a dog who's pulling on your shoelaces or biting your hands, so this behaviour is easy to accidentally reward. Even a sharp "bad dog!" is attention, even if it's negative.
				<br/><br/>
				<strong>Common suggestions:</strong><br/>
				<ul>
				<li>Yelp loudly when your dog bites too hard. This typically works better for puppies who are still learning, as this is how their littermates tell them what is and isn't acceptable. However, yelping can sometimes make the dog even more excited, making them bite harder, not softer!</li>
				<li>Redirect your dog to a toy she is allowed to chew, or a tug toy if she wants to play. This teaches the dog which objects are suitable for chewing and biting. This is great for puppies who are teething or just want to have a nibble on something.</li>
				<li>Bad: hold the dog's mouth closed or press on their tongue. This makes the dog uncomfortable and discourages them from biting. However, this can damage your relationship with the dog and have unpredictable consequences. Read more about reewards vs punishment (here).</li>
				<li>Stand up and move away when your dog is play-biting, or end the game if play gets too rough.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				The last item on the list is my personal recommendation for dogs who are consistently play-biting and when no other method is helping.<br/><br/>
				<strong>Ensure the unwanted behaviour is never rewarded:</strong> train the dog that chewing on a human makes them vanish. As soon as your dog puts their teeth on your skin, get up and leave the room. Don't try and redirect the dog to a toy, don't push her away, don't give a command like "no" or "off"... Instantly stand up and get outta there. Your dog wants attention, so if they learn that being toothy makes you leave, they will stop being toothy!
				<br/></br>
				<strong>Teach an alternative behaviour:</strong> how would you rather your dog asks for your attention? It's up to you! Maybe he could plop his head on your lap, lie on his bed, or sit at your feet. If your dog has approached and is clearly about to try and get your attention, anticipate the coming nibbles and instead ask for a "sit" or a "down". If your dog offers the sit, "good boy!", get out the favourite toy, and reward him with a play session. You've stopped him practising the unwanted behaviour (play-biting) and encouraged a desirable behaviour (sit).<br/><br/>

If your dog picks this up and starts sitting at your feet to ask for attention, reward him for it, even if you're busy and can only offer a quick "good boy!" and treat, or a two minute play session. The more you reward the desirable behaviour, the more he'll see that it works, and the more likely he'll choose to sit instead of choosing to nibble. Then direct him to his bed and give him something else to do, like chew on a bone or a stuffed Kong. He can happily chew away for a while and you get some peace to work.
				</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">Playing rough</h2>
				<h4>
				Teaching a dog how rough is too rough is approached in a similar way to play-biting. Let's say your dog is playing appropriately. Reward her with more play! But if a dog starts playing too rough, maybe biting at your hands or legs, or barreling into you, end the play session immediately. Put the toy away, turn away from your dog, stand still and be boring. If your dog calms down, reward them by restarting the play session. If your dog doesn't calm down, go into a different room for thirty seconds or only return once your dog has calmed down. Then reward them by reinitiating the play!<br/><br/>
				This method teaches the dog that certain styles of play will mean an end to the play session, so they'll learn to avoid doing certain things. A great way to encourage this from the start is to have structured play sessions, where you regularly interrupt play with a moment of calm. For example, "tug with rules" (link) can involve regularly asking your dog to "drop it" and "leave it" with the tug toy, then rewarding his good behaviour with more tug. With fetch, you can ask your dog to sit in between throws. By regularly asking your dog to perform these cues, they'll get better at following your lead and understanding what you want them to do in all situations, not just the ones you've specifically trained them for.
				</h4>

				<h2 class="mid-two">House training</h2>
				<h4>
				On any puppy or dog forum, house training has to be one of the most frequent complaints - and understandably so! Play-biting or pulling on walks can be annoying, but constantly needing to clean your carpets is a different matter.
